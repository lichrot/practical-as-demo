# [practical-as-demo] The Fibonacci Edition

Go read [this](https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) instead.  
NB: Currently, you have to manually recompile AssemblyScript sources (located in [`./wasm/`](/wasm/)) with `npm run build:asc`. The command `npm run build` recompiles AS automatically.

# [📜] Todo

- Figure out how to watch and recompile AssemblyScript folder. Rollup/Vite plugin???
- Deal with top-level await (generated by AssemblyScript compiler)
- Maybe make a Vite scaffold template, I dunno
